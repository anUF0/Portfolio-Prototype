# Prototype Portfolio
## Intent
For this second challenge of this dev course, we tasked with creating portfolio-style website. One minor hurdle for me, however, is that I do have anything to really show foor myself, coding-wise. So, I moreso looked at this project with a more technical focus, not really caring too much about the actual site's content. That is to say, I had a little bit of fun with this one.

## Usage
The tone of the site is fairly open about it beind somewhat farcical, though all the elements should work. The first three nav bar options should snap to each of their relevent headers, with the exepction of the final one, which should inniate a download an older Resume of mine.

The about me section gives some insight into my bacground, but since I have only really begun coding, there is not a lot of pertanent information. Instead, I simply ask my views to have fun and see where the, somewhat electic images take them.

The images should link a user to a tangentially related website for the image in quesiton. Most are jokes that only I find funny, though I hope someone can get a chuckle out of them.

The footer where I stored my contact information does link to my Github account and that is infact my email address. Though the phone number is obviously fake, as I do not currently own a work phone.
